#
# Runs the Rust Musializer on a private display and captures evidence, so a
# session can check its own work without a human looking at a screen.
#
# Adapted from ../musializer/tools/ui_capture.sh and its UI_REVIEW.md. The
# isolation guarantees are the same and they are the point:
#
#   - a private Xvfb display (:77 by default), so nothing is drawn on the
#     operator's session, no window takes focus, and the real cursor never moves;
#   - WAYLAND_DISPLAY unset, so GLFW cannot pick the operator's compositor;
#   - PULSE_SERVER pointed at a path that cannot resolve, so a check never opens
#     a client stream on the audio server the operator is using;
#   - every artifact under build/, which .gitignore excludes.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/headless_check.sh [OUTPUT_DIR]
#
# Environment:
#   MUSIALIZER_CAPTURE_DISPLAY   X display to use (default :77)
#   MUSIALIZER_PROBE_FRAMES      frames to render before exiting (default 240)
#   MUSIALIZER_FIXTURE_SECONDS   synthetic fixture length (default 8)

# Adapted from ../musializer/tools/ui_capture.sh. UI_REVIEW.md records the
# lesson that pays for this section: the two worst defects ever found there were
# invisible to capture until the probe could name the state that showed them. A
# surface that cannot be photographed does not get reviewed, so every scene and
# every panel gets a frame, at the minimum supported window as well as at 720p.
#
# The report is parsed rather than eyeballed. `scene request: honoured` is the
# line that distinguishes "--scene parsed" from "--scene took effect", which a
# screenshot of a placeholder card cannot.
